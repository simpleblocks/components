Blocks are functionnal React components that representes the different draggable elements on the site canvas. They range from fundemantal elements like `div` or `image` to more complex elements like a `Carousel` or `ImageGallery`.

You can use any Block inside another more complex block. For example, `ImageGallery` will contain multiple `div` and `image` elements.
